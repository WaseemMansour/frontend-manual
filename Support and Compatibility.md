## Support and Compatibility

While we are committed to ensuring the things we build can be used by as many users as possible, we also believe deep retroactive support hinders progress, so we try to make sure our work strikes the right balance of browser and device support.

### Support Checklist

For most projects, we should test exhaustively and make sure things work as expected in the following:

#### Mobile Platforms
*Latest versions ofâ€¦*

* iOS
* Android

#### Mobile browsers
*Latest versions ofâ€¦*

* Mobile Safari
* Chrome for Mobile

#### Desktop Platforms
* Windows
* MacOS
* Linux

#### Desktop browsers
*Two latest versions ofâ€¦*

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari

*And it should also work inâ€¦*

* Microsoft Edge
* Internet Explorer 10 and up

This doesn't mean that it has to look exactly the same across different browsers. But rather that the overall functionality should work and that the content should be accessible.

### Resources

#### Suggestions

* When doing testing (and primarily design testing) we should do it both on retina and non retina screens. For example some fonts might have an excellent readability on smaller sizes on retina screens but are almost unreadable without retina.
