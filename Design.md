## Design

We think adopting a few common sense practices during the early design stages can help prevent friction later on, when we get to code. So we suggest everyone follows a few simple procedures, to ensure the transition from design to code is as seamless and natural as possible.

### Software

You're free to use whatever software you want (including none at all) to design, but please be mindful of the impact your choices will have on the rest of the team. We try to use Sketch as much as possible for UI design, and it should be your preferred tool, as it's accessible to most of the team. Other software (e.g. Adobe CC, Affinity Designer, Principle) can still be used for other tasks, such as illustration, photo manipulation, motion graphics or print, but please make sure choosing it won't block someone else in the team from picking up where you left off.

### Typefaces

Choice of typefaces should be tailored for the project's needs. If doing work primarily for the Web, the typefaces should be optimised and license-able for Web use. We have accounts at several subscription services, so we recommend you browse and consider those first when choosing typefaces for a project. You'll find a list of these services, along with other relevant links, below.

Please be mindful of the impact Webfonts will have on the site's performance. Most services require loading additional external resources, which delays the site's first paint. If possible, try to choose typefaces that we can embed directly via `@font-face`.

### Presentation and Mock-ups

You're free to use whatever tools you prefer to present proposals and/or mock-ups to clients, but we recommend using InVision for prototyping UI work. It's a robust service, has an almost seamless integration with Sketch and has proved to be client-friendly. For other types of work, we're partial to using short and to-the-point PDF presentations.

### Design Files

As soon as the design work has been approved and it's moving to code, you should upload all of the original design files plus any necessary assets (e.g. fonts, icons, original images, etc) to Google Drive, under the client's folder (go to Drive > Clients and check for a folder with the client's name, or create one in case it doesn't exist). **This is required procedure, even for projects you're the only one working on**. Whenever there have been major updates to any of the design files or assets, you should re-upload them (Drive takes care of file history and versioning).
